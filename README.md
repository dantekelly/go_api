# GO API

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a Go library that enhances database throughput and availability by caching user information. The library ensures that every request for user data is efficiently managed to reduce unnecessary database queries.

## Motivation

In scenarios where a system experiences thousands of requests per second for user information, the database often becomes a bottleneck. To alleviate this issue, we need a caching mechanism that minimizes direct database interactions while still fulfilling all user data requests.

## How It Works

The library intercepts requests for user data and checks if the requested information is already in the cache. If it is, the data is returned from the cache, bypassing the database. If the data is not in the cache, the library retrieves it from the database, stores it in the cache, and then returns it to the requester. This process significantly reduces the number of database queries.

For example, if there are 1,000 requests for user data and only 100 of them are for unique user IDs, the library ensures that only 100 requests are made to the database. All 1,000 requests will receive a response with the user data, either from the cache or the database.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Database Load:** By minimizing the number of direct queries to the database, the library helps in managing the database load more effectively.
- **Improved Response Times:** Cached responses lead to faster data retrieval, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Scalability:** The caching mechanism allows the system to handle a higher volume of requests without degrading performance.

## Conclusion

The GO API library provides a robust solution for caching user information, ensuring efficient database usage and improved system performance. It is an essential tool for systems dealing with high volumes of user data requests.
